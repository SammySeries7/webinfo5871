				<h3>What Topic Modelling is and how to use it to gain information</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Topic modelling is a technique which assigns topic to a given corpus based on the words present. Topic modelling is important, because in this world full of data it has become increasingly important to categories the documents. For example, a company receives hundreds of reviews, then it is important for the company to know what categories of reviews are more important and vice versa. Topics can be thought of as keywords which can describe a document, for example, for a topic sports the words that come to our mind our volleyball, basketball, tennis, cricket etc. A topic model is a model, which can automatically detect topics based on the words appearing in a document. In this section, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) will be used as the topic modelling.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model for topic modeling. LDA assumes that documents are composed of a mixture of topics, where a topic is a distribution over a fixed set of words. Each document is generated by, first, sampling a distribution over topics from a Dirichlet distribution, sampling a topic from the previously sampled distribution over topics for each word in the document, and sampling a word from the topic accordingly. The model is unsupervised, which means it learns the topics from the data without any prior knowledge about the data. The algorithm iteratively updates the topic distribution and word distribution until convergence, using a technique called Gibbs sampling. 
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>
					The method is used to cluster the texts following their abstract topics. Several clusters will be tested in the LDA model to assess how well each topic is perceived by using coherence measures. After that, the topic definition will be interpreted from the terms in each topic, and the model can also be assigned the topic for each document following the topic distribution. In addition, after the suitable number of clusters is selected, LDA helps visualize how close the topics in documents are by using the principal component analysis.

			<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
			<br>
				<p>
					The data cleaned in the previous chapter was stored in the csv format. The lemmatized text data was performed by CounterVectorizer and normalized by using TF-IDF. The parameters are shown in the pictures below.
				</p>

				<div class="caption">The CounterVectorizer and TF-IDF parameter</div>
				</div>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					The document-term matrix is generated from the CounterVectorizer model named “MyCountV,” and the vocabularies are stored in the ColumnNames. Then, the wordcloud package is used to visualize all words in the texts to check the strange word format.

				</div>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					LatentDirichletAllocation from the Sklearn package is implemented with the three clusters. After the model is generated, the top 50 words are shown in the picture below. Then, the model is used in pyLDAvis to help visualize the terms in each topic along with checking how close each topic is.

			<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>

			<div class="img">
			<img width="600" src="image/assignment2/part3/C_V score.png">
			<div class="caption">coherence score c_v</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				The suitable number of clusters is the first object to check. The coherence score from the genism package is used for scoring each number of clusters. The coherence measure  represents the “quality human perception” about topics in unique, objective, and easy-to-evaluate numbers. The topic coherence metric assesses how well a topic is supported by a text set, which is called reference corpus. It uses statistics and probabilities drawn from the reference corpus, especially focused on the word’s context, to give a coherence score to a topic. According to the picture above, the appropriate numbers of clusters are 3, 4, and 5 respectively.  Three is a suitable number for clustering, which is confirmed by scores in the above figure.

			<h4>3-cluster model</h4>
			
			<br>
			<div class="img">
			<img width="600" src="image/assignment2/part3/pyldavis_3.png">
			<div class="caption">The first topic</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				In the 3-cluster model, the first topic contains the battery properties and attributes terms such as “range,” “mile,” “charging station,” “home,” “afford,” and “time”.  With these words, it is  implicitly interpreted that consumers are concerned with the limited range of EVs. The long charging time and limited charging station are what they worry about. The price of EVs is unreasonably high compared to gas-powered cars. An EV, also, needs a garage to charge a battery during the night. 
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<div class="img">
			<img width="600" src="image/assignment2/part3/pyldavis_3_2.jpg">
			<div class="caption">The second topic</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				The second topic is all about Elon Musk and Tesla. The outstanding words are “tesla”, “musk”, “elon”, “model”, “stock” and “price”. These words indicate the role of Elon Musk on the EVs’ society. Elon musk is Tesla's CEO. He often says and guides the direction of EVs, which often has an impact on Tesla's stock price. His products such as model-3, model-x, and model-y often get accused of being too expensive. 
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<div class="img">
			<img width="600" src="image/assignment2/part3/pyldavis_3_3.jpg">
			<div class="caption">The third topic</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				The third topic is the impact of batteries on the environment. The outstanding words are “environment”, “lithium”, “fossil”, “recycle” and “mining”. EVs’ batteries are made of lithium which comes from mining. Lithium mining has lots of impact on the environment. Batteries are very hard to recycle because they are made of complex components and rare earth minerals. Regarding power sources for EVs, electricity in the United States largely comes from the fossil fuel generator, which causes greenhouse gas and air pollution. All words in each topic will be summarized in the figure below.

			<h4>5-cluster model</h4>
			
			<br>
			<div class="img">
			<img width="600" src="image/assignment2/part3/pyldavis_5_2.jpg">
			<div class="caption">The second topic</div>

			<div class="img">

			<img width="600" src="image/assignment2/part3/plot_from pa_5_2.png">
			<div class="caption">The summary words in each topics</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				In the case of the 5-cluster model, the coherence measure gives the score around 0.48, whereas the 3-cluster coherence measure gives the score around 0.54. The difference in the score causes ambiguous EVs’ topics in the former model. According to the first two figures, the second cluster and the fifth cluster seem to have similar terms in their topics. The second can be assumed that it is related to Elon’s activities in the EVs’ society. However, the fifth combines many subtopics, which cause the ambiguous interpretation of meaning. According to the last figure, other topics are subtle differences from the 3-cluster model. The first may be about charging stations and batteries. The second is about the environmental issues from battery production. The third and the fourth are the problems mentioned earlier. The last one is about models and other brands in the EVs’ industry.

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			
			<p>
				Latent Dirichlet Allocation gives the most clear understanding among the 3 clusters. The topics are the battery properties and attributes, Elon Musk and Tesla, and environmental impacts from EVs. The coherent measure plays an important role to help select the appropriate number of clusters in the model. The 3-cluster model’s score is 0.54, whereas the 5-cluster is about 0.48. The higher score makes the topic easier to understand. The 5-cluster model cannot properly differentiate the topic of Elon musk from the other topics.
