				<h3> </h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Most Americans are reluctant to use EVs in the next few years due to the four main reasons: availability of charging stations, cost of the EVs, nonsustained battery, and EVs news. Not enough charging stations is one of the main problems. Most EV consumers love to go on a road trip, which ranges from several hundred to a few thousand miles. However, many interstate roads do not have enough facilities to support these travelers. In addition, a charging time can be varied on different locations, which ranges from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours each time. It increases the trip duration and causes inconvenience to some drivers. 
				</p>
	
				<br>				
				
				<p>
					Many people in the US rent homes and do not have a private garage that can charge their EVs overnight. Therefore, they have to drive their cars to charging stations. However, the charging stations are not enough to support all cars. Some areas have specific time to be available for charging, which obstructs consumers to use EVs in daily life as well.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					Another problem is EV’s price, which is costly. The price is more than 50K USD, which is equivalent to some luxury gas-powered cars. The price also varies by the battery size. For example, a long range Tesla car costs more than 60K USD, and has a driving range around 400 miles per charge. This price can get one a good truck as well. Therefore, many consumers prefer to buy trucks rather than the electric cars because the cost of maintenance is cheaper, and the truck can be used in a variety of ways. 					“Afford,” “price,” “expensive,” “cheap,” and “unaffordable” express the “cost” label. All terms represent consumers’ opinion that EVs are expensive and unaffordable for most people. They also have high maintenance costs compared to gas-powered cars. 

				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Some people decline to use EVs because of the battery. EV users in the cold areas, like Wisconsin, found that the battery life does not sustain long enough to deliver a daily ride. The main reason is that the battery needs to be heated to be warm enough to deliver electricity to cars. According to the dataset, approximately 20 percent of total electricity will be lost for battery heating in the cold areas. Regarding the important words for the battery label, there are “cold,” “range,” “weather,” “winter,” and “mile,”  All words have impacts on the EV’s battery life as mentioned above.
				</p>

				<p>
					Regarding the environment, many consumers think that some components in EVs’ batteries come from mining such as lithium, so this could cause air pollution and global warming. It can also lead to human trafficking in mining. Besides, some consumers believe that electricity is mainly generated from fossil fuel, so it does not make sense to continue to use EV’s to save our world. Recycling is also the main factor to make a decision to buy EVs. Many consumers feel uncertain about how to recycle the batteries because the batteries are made from advanced technology and the complicated production process. It can cause detrimental effects to the environment.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					With regard to the “environment” label, “mining,” “recycle,” “lithium,” “emission,” and “fossil” are the representative terms. Lithium is the main component in the battery, which is the product from mining. Mining has negative effects on the environment such as global warming and air pollution. In addition, many big states such as California often encounter electricity blackouts, so fossil fuel is an alternative to generate electricity. Many EV opponents think that EVs will aggravate the existing problem. Using fossil fuels will worsen the global warming situation.

				<br>
				<p>
					With regard to the “infrastructure” label, there are “charger,” “station,” and “grid. All words express that EVs’ infrastructure in the US is not good enough in the view of consumers. People need more charger stations in cities and along interstate roads to make daily use and a road trip possible. There are many examples to illustrate the problems such as the electricity blackouts and charging time and the facilities constraints. Even in the cities, the number of facilities is not enough. Many EVs’ consumers have to get in the line and wait at least 45 minutes per charge.

				<br>
				<p>
					Another reason is the EVs’ manufacturer and news. Currently, the leading EVs’ manufacturer is Tesla, owned by Elon Musk. Every movement of Elon causes both positive and negative impact on EVs' society. For example, when Elon bought twitter, the tesla consumers felt frustrated because the quality of Tesla could decrease as many of them buy Tesla because of their trust in Elon Musk. In addition, many consumers are interested in EV models such as FORD MUSTANG, MACH-E, and Ford F-150 Lightning. They are looking for the cheaper EVs’ model with higher range per trip.

				<br>
				<p>
					In terms of the “news” label, “tesla”, “stock”, and “volkswagen” have an impact on news in the EVs’ industries. Tesla is the leading EV’s manufacturer. Its products persuade consumers to use EVs more. Tesla invests a lot of money on the charging stations, which makes the EV platforms more competitive. In the meantime, other companies like Volkswagen launch new EV models such as ID4 in the market. Every movement of EVs’ companies affects the company’s stock price in both positive and negative ways. Other documents are regarding the stock in the EV industry. Most investors discuss the growth rate and business plan of Tesla that it has the potential to affect the stock price. Some people talk about Chinese’s EV companies such as Lucid and BYD. They believe that EVs from China would reduce the EV price in the US.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					According to the data, to make EVs more convincing, it needs several things. The first thing is the price. EVs’ price is still high for average people. As mentioned before, battery is the main factor on the price. Therefore, the new component needs to be researched and employed in EVs’ batteries instead of Lithium to make the price lower. The second idea is the charging facilities. Many Americans rent homes from landlords, so it is impossible to install charging facilities by themselves. The government needs to support the charging facilities in popular locations as well as interstate roads. In addition, the government and EVs’ companies need to do research on how to generate more electricity from renewable energy like solar panels. It cannot rely on just fossil energy and hydroelectric energy. Regarding the battery performance, 300 miles per charging is the number that most consumers are happy with. However, in cold states like Wisconsin, some energy needs to be used to heat a battery. The EVs companies have to find a way to solve this problem. The batteries need work on every condition regardless of a preheated process. In addition, the companies need to explain how to recycle the batteries after they die. Many consumers feel uncertain about the process and afraid of making the global warming issue worse. Besides, some of them do not like to use Lithium in EVs’ batteries because of the mining process. A lot of people like to see the EVs’ industry be competitive like this because it will help reduce the car price in the long term and provide more opportunities for consumers in terms of products and economy.
